# Gentle introduction to programming

In a typical p5.js sketch, the users are typically typing their own code after at least `setup()` function is defined.

Since there is no need to define the `setup()` function in CodeGuppy, students can learn programming in a progressive way.

Functions can be introduced later in the curriculum, once the basic knowledge of JavaScript is assimilated.

```
stroke("Navy");

for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    circle(400, 300, i);
}
```
