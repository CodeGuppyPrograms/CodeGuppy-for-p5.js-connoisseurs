# No setup()

Users familiar with p5.js know that one of the first functions they have to define in their sketch is the `setup()` function.

With CodeGuppy the p5.js `setup()` function is no longer required. It will be ignored if you try to define it. As an educational environment, CodeGuppy does a few decisions automatically for the program in order to simplify coding for beginners.

CodeGuppy automatically initiate the canvas to 800x600 resolution.

```
circle(400, 300, 200);
```
