# Type-in programs

With CodeGuppy, type-in programs are back! Popular in the 70s and 80s, type-in programs were small programs included in magazines or other printed materials that required users to enter them from the keyboard.

Although this method of entering programs is not very time efficient, it is very good in educational terms. Users that type in programs gets comfortable much quicker with the language and eventually learn to program much faster.

Afterall, coding is all about typing programs using the keyboard.

How CodeGuppy enables type-in programs? Very simple: all assets and libraries come included! Users donâ€™t need to focus on project organization or asset management. They only need to open the code editor and type the program.

> Educators and parents can leverage this feature and hand over printed code listings to kids so they can exercise typing.
