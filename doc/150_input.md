# Support “INPUT” programs

If you’re building string processing programs, or even some games, you often need to ask for user input. For instance, to enter a long text using the keyboard.

CodeGuppy provides two very simple APIs to display textbox-es and buttons.

The two functions are `createTextBox()` and `createButton()`. They operate on the top most layer, therefore they are displayed on top of the graphical canvas.
