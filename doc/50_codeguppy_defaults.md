# CodeGuppy defaults

CodeGuppy changes a few of the p5.js defaults to different values.

For instance:
-	There is no fill color defined upon program initialization. Try to draw a few shapes and youâ€™ll see that they are transparent
-	The default angle mode is changed to DEGREES. p5.js sketches uses RADIANS as default.
