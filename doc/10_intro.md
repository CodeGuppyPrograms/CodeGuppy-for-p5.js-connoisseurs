# What is CodeGuppy?

CodeGuppy.com is an online environment where kids, teens and creative adults learn and practice JavaScript via creative coding.

CodeGuppy is based on the popular [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [p5.play](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) and [p5.scenemanager](https://github.com/mveteanu/p5.SceneManager) libraries. 

Since CodeGuppy is intended to education, a few extra extensions has been added on top of the above mentioned libraries.

This tutorial is indended for:

- users that are familiar with p5.js and are coming to CodeGuppy
- users that want to graduate from CodeGuppy to p5.js
