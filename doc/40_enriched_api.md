# Enriched drawing API

CodeGuppy enriches the p5.js drawing APIs with a few new functions that are easier to use and understand by young coders.

For example: `circle()`

Did you know you can have lots of fun with just one function? Checkout this code extracted from the first CodeGuppy lesson.

```
// Draw bear face
circle(400, 300, 200);

// Draw left year
circle(250, 100, 50);
circle(270, 122, 20);

// Draw right year
circle(550, 100, 50);
circle(530, 122, 20);

// Draw left eye
circle(300, 220, 30);
circle(315, 230, 10);

// Draw right eye
circle(500, 220, 30);
circle(485, 230, 10);

// Draw nose
circle(400, 400, 90);
circle(400, 350, 20);
